Hi! I use whole genome sequence data to study bacterial evolution. I am particularly understanding how plasmids are maintained in natural populations of bacteria, eg in patients colonised by bacteria or people with infections. I work on the computer trying to test theoretical predictions about plasmid evolution, eg writing code to classify mutations in bacterial samples and make statistical inferences about how they are evolving.
