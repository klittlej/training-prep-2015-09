I am an associate professor of medicine, biostatistics, and bioinformatics at Boston University. My research is in the area of genomic medicine; my group develops statistical and computational tools for analyzing high throughput biomedical data. We work in a large number of diseases to study mechanisms of etiology and progression, and we develop biomarkers to predict disease occurance, prognosis, and treatment efficacy.
