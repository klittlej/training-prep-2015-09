I have a Ph.D. in math and an M.S. in CS. I've taught undergraduate CS (mostly
the first two years) 1980-2015 except for a five-year stint at HP Labs. I'm
now retired. I thoroughly enjoyed teaching and would like to keep my hand
in. I acted as helper in three SWC workshops held at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln.
