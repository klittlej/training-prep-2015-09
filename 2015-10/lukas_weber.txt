I am a PhD student in statistical bioinformatics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. My PhD project is on developing improved statistical and computational methods for analyzing data from mass cytometry experiments. Mass cytometry is a new experimental technique to measure protein expression levels in individual cells, with challenging data analysis problems due to high dimensionality and large size of data sets. In my PhD, I will develop new data analysis methods, and implement them as R packages for Bioconductor.
