I am an economist by training, and work as a data scientist at Civis Analytics.
My role is about equal parts machine learning and statistics researcher, statistical
consultant, and software engineer. I contribute to the Python data stack, am
the co-lead developer of the statsmodels project, and often lead tutorials
at meetups and universities on doing numerical computing and data wrangling with
Python.
