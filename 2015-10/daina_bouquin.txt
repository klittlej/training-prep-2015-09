In October I'm starting my new job as the Assistant Head Librarian of the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, MA. My work focuses
on data and computational literacy and fostering community development among
researchers in computationally-intensive settings. I have a MS in Library and
Information Science from Syracuse University and am currently pursing a second
MS as a distance student through the City University of New York in Data 
Analytics. I'm excited to go through Software Carpentry Training.
