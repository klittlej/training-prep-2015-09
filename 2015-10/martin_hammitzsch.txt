I am involved in the development of early warning and fast response systems in the field of natural hazards for several years while working at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. The need of opening scientific software in my work so that the scientific contribution is acknowledged led me to a project which is pushing software publications in sciences, especially the geo-sciences. Since then I am active in some communities to push Open Science especially in the context of scientific software.
