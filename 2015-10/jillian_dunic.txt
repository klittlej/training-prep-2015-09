I study human drivers of biodiversity change in the ocean through large-scale data analysis coupled with field experiments. I am interested in examining these changes from local to global scales. Specifically, I work on understanding how habitat patchiness structures ecological communities and affects ecosystem functioning. Also, I'm currently teaching a semester-long introduction to practical computing in R course for graduate students!
