I am a researcher at the European Bioinformatics Institute where I lead the team in charge of the development of the Gene Ontology (GO) and its usage for annotation of scientific papers. My research interests are on biomedical data standards and integration, specifically using semantic web, ontologies and linked data to enable querying of datasets and answer biological questions or raise new ones.
