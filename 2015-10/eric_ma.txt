I am a 5th year graduate student at MIT Biological Engineering. I am solving problems in infectious disease using data science techniques. Problems I am currently working on are:

1. Identifying reassortant influenza viruses at scale.
2. Predicting influenza and HIV phenotype from genotype data using ensemble learning and neural networks.
3. Phasing influenza genomic segments in mixed samples using NGS data.

I have led two tutorials at PyCon 2014 and 2015, on data analysis and network analysis respectively. 

I'd love to connect! You can find me below:
