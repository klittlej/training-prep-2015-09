My main project at the moment is using RNA sequence data (Illumina 
RNA-seq and its variations like ChIP-seq and CAGE-seq, as well as PacBio 
Iso-seq) to determine transcript structures in a high-expression, 
gene-dense viral genome. I'm also more broadly interested in cellular 
and viral transcriptome analysis.
