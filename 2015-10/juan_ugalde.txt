I'm currently an Assistant Professor at the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics, Universidad Mayor, in Chile.
My work focuses in using genomics and metagenomics approaches to understand microbial diversity, using both novel datasets, but also taking advantage of information that is already available in databases.
