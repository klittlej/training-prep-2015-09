I am currently working at Boston University as a "Scientific Programmer /
Analyst" with the Research Computing Services team. My primary roles are 1) to
help the BU research community to develop/optimize/parallelize software they
need for their research, particularly as they scale up and make use of our
supercomputing cluster, and 2) to teach introductory tutorials to get
researchers started with popular languages and applications (e.g. Python,
MATLAB, R, OpenMP, etc.).

My research background is in Geology & Geophysics, specifically the impact of
glacial erosion on mountain size and shape over the past ~6 million years. With
respect to programming, my work includes numerical modelling of glaciers,
rivers, and mountain topography, as well as computationally intensive analysis
of experimental and laboratory data. God-willing, I will earn my PhD from Yale
in the coming months.
